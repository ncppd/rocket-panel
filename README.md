An automated script I made in order to quickly generate bitstreams with different Rocket parameters for testing purposes. 
Used with https://github.com/ncppd/rc-fpga-zcu, just place the scripts inside the zcu102 directory, and create a new directory generated-bitstream in the same directory with rc-fpga-zcu.
For the moment this is a work in progress and as so it contains many hardcoded paths and other issues that I might have not encountered yet.
